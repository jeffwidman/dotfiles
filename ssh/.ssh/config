# SSH Config File


## Generating keys: ##
    # `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 100 -C "jeff@jeffwidman.com macbook air"`

    # SSH key-gen options:
    # -t specifies the type; ed25519 is better than RSA, and became the default starting in OpenSSH 8.5.
    # -a specifies the rounds for bcrypt when saving the private key using the new OpenSSH format
    # -C comment


## Example using ProxyJump to access a DB server via a jumpbox ##
#Host jbox
    # HostName can be either domain name or IP address
    #HostName jumpbox.test.com
    #User jeff
    #Port 1093

    #Host rc-db
        #Hostname db
        #User jeff
        #ProxyJump jbox
        # Create tunnel from local port 5433 to PostgreSQL (port 5432)
        #LocalForward 5433 localhost:5432

#Host *+*
    # Split `ssh jumphost+targethost` into `ssh jumphost -W targethost:%p`
    # Primarily useful when the targethost is a generic name that refers to
    # different servers depending on the jumphost. For example, redis01 is
    # a different box in datacenter1 vs datacenter2. Implementing this requires
    # ProxyCommand instead of ProxyJump because ProxyJump doesn't support
    # splitting the hostname into parts.
    #ProxyCommand ssh $(echo %h | sed 's/+[^+]*$//;s/\([^+%%]*\)%%\([^+]*\)$/\2 -l \1/;s/:/ -p /') -W $(echo %h:%p | sed 's/^.*+//;/:/!s/$/ /')
