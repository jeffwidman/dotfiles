# My dotfiles.

Works on *nix, optimized for OS X.

Managed using [Stow](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), so you can pick and
choose which programs to install.

## Philosophy

Initially I tried entirely automating the entire install process, but quickly
found it wasn't worth the maintenance. Starting from scratch happens so rarely
for me that each time I was fiddling with the bootstrap scripts to work around
a random issue (often due to a new version of OSX).

Instead, it's simpler to install stuff by hand, and manage only the
configuration files (dotfiles) in this repo.

## Install steps on a clean OSX machine:

1. Make hidden files/folder [visible in Finder](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/99213/is-it-possible-to-always-show-hidden-dotfiles-in-open-save-dialogs):
      `defaults write -g AppleShowAllFiles -bool true`

2. `git clone git@github.com:jeffwidman/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`
  - If cloning to a server without a Github-connected SSH key use 'https' instead:
      `git clone https://github.com/jeffwidman/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`

3. Install desired binaries using your favorite package manager:
  - If on OSX, use Homebrew:
    1. Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).
    2. Install [Homebrew Bundle](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle): `$ brew tap Homebrew/bundle`
    3. `$ brew bundle --file=~/.dotfiles/homebrew/.Brewfile`
    After the `.Brewfile` is symlinked into ``~/.Brewfile`, just use `$ brew bundle --global`.
  - Make sure Stow gets installed, we'll use this later to symlink the dotfiles.
  - Ruby:
    1. Use [`rvm`](http://rvm.io/) instead of Homebrew. Much easier to manage
    gemsets, ruby versions, etc.
  - Node:
    1. Use [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) instead of Homebrew for
    managing Node.
    2. Install/upgrade [manually using `git`]
    (https://github.com/creationix/nvm#manual-install) rather than `nvm`'s
    `install.sh` script.
    3. Unfortunately, `nvm` drastically slows shell startup time due to
    https://github.com/creationix/nvm/issues/966, so after installing node
    (`nvm install node`), run `nvm unalias default` to disable the alias. Just
    remember to first run `nvm use node` whenever you want to run webpack, etc.

4. Make ZSH the default shell:
  1. `$ sudo vim /etc/shells`
  2. Append the path to zsh - Homebrew sticks it in `/usr/local/bin/zsh`
  3. Save and exit
  4. `$ chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh`

5. Install Prezto:
  `git clone --recursive git@github.com:sorin-ionescu/prezto.git "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zprezto"`

  - The default Prezto instructions say to symlink the default config files.
    **Don't do this**; instead use Stow to symlink your own config files (instructions below).
  - To update Prezto: `git pull && git submodule update --init --recursive`

5. Now use `stow` to symlink the various config files:
  - `$ cd ~/.dotfiles/`
  - `$ stow PACKAGE_NAME` will symlink all the files inside of the package_name's folder into the parent directory (in this case, the user's home folder.)
  - Stow thoughtfully raises an error if the symlink destination already exists. For example, installing ZSH creates a default `~/.zshrc` and `~/.zshlogin`. Just delete these default files before stowing your customized versions.
  - If using a different OS than OS X, some packages may store their config files at a different location. For example, the fonts folder. Just specify the full destination path for Stow.

     - http://kianmeng.org/blog/2014/03/08/using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles/
  - Several config files aren't `stow`able--review the list below

6. Other apps I commonly install:
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - be sure to [install the shell command `code`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line).
  - [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/downloads.html)
  - [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/?l=en)
  - [PGAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/macosx.php) / [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/)
  - [MySQLWorkbench](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)
  - [Robomongo](https://robomongo.org/)
  - [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
  - [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
  - [BetterTouchTool](https://boastr.net//)
  - [OS X /etc/hosts GUI](https://github.com/specialunderwear/Hosts.prefpane)

7. ZSH completion scripts:
  Symlink any completion scripts into ``/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/``.
  The filename must begin with an `_` or `zsh` will not read it. Prezto caches
  the output of `compinit`, to rebuild the cache do: `rm -rf ~/.zcomp* && compinit`

  Note: Many homebrew formula automatically handle installing the formula's
  completion scripts. For example, `brew install the_silver_searcher`(`ag`)
  will also install a completion script for `ag` in `/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/`.

  Docker completion scripts - I opened https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/issues/1459 to try to get this into prezto:

    ln -s /Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/etc/docker.zsh-completion /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_docker
    ln -s /Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/etc/docker-machine.zsh-completion /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_docker-machine
    ln -s /Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/etc/docker-compose.zsh-completion /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_docker-compose

##List of config files

 - VSCode - Settings are stowable, but extensions are purposefully excluded. At this time, there's no way to favorite/bookmark recommendations on the Visual Studio Marketplace. When there is, I'll start creating a list of the ones I use.
 - bash
 - git
 - Homebrew Brewfile - stowable, `brew bundle --global` will use $HOME/.Brewfile
 - nvim - Neovim. No need to stow as it respects `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`
 - python - not stowable, use `pip install -r ~/.dotfiles/python/requirements.txt`
 - ruby
 - tmux - #TODO
 - vim - for when Neovim isn't available
 - vimify - `.inputrc` and `.editrc` make vim commands work in many interactive
    shells, for example the mysql and postgres shells
 - zsh - includes prezto config files

##Misc Notes:

List of possible macOS customizations: https://mths.be/macos

For themes, check out the [Base16 template system](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16). It includes templates for
theming many different apps.

Colorschemes that I like:
 - monokai
 - solarized
 - railscasts

Fonts that I like:
 - Ubuntu Monospace including powerline fix
 - Adobe Source Code (look for powerline fix)

##TODO:

 - add https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles/blob/master/ctags/ctags to make ctags parse ruby and js better
 - how to use ctags http://scholarslab.org/research-and-development/code-spelunking-with-ctags-and-vim/

 - Improve my vimrc and nvimrc - vim plugins:
   - vim-markdown Markdown syntax highlighting for Vim
   - syntastic (pylint, pep8, pyflakes linters)
   - youcompleteme
   - tasklist
   - taglist (and ctags) (tagbar as alternative?)
   - nerdtree

 - add ipython (replaces python interpreter)

 - add powerline - used in vim, [zsh](http://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/usage/shell-prompts.html), ipython, and tmux

 - gitignore add:
    - https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Global/Vagrant.gitignore
    - https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Global/VirtualEnv.gitignore
    - https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Global/vim.gitignore
