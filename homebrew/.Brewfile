# Because making a non-Apple SSH work with the macOS Keychain can be a pain
# brew 'ssh'


# Install all the things:
brew 'zsh'
brew 'ssh-copy-id'
brew 'fasd' # Fast directory switcher
brew 'git'
brew 'gibo' # quickly access Github's git ignore templates

# brew cask install visualvm

# Node
# Use [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) instead of Homebrew.
# Install manually using git clone rather than the install script:
# https://github.com/creationix/nvm#manual-install

# Neovim
# I prefer over Vim for the simple reason they accepted one of my patches ;)
brew 'neovim'
